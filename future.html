          <h3>Private</h3>
          <p>A Private Cloud is a cloud storage that is held specificly on site for business. These clouds are for business that use confidintial information and can not risk the information getting out, or companies that cannot trust a 3rd party company to handle their information. This type of cloud is much more secure being located on site my the business and not having to work through a 3rd party, this allows for a much more secure way to use a cloud business wide.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <h3>Public</h3>
            <p>A public cloud is the opposite of a private cloud. The public cloud is provided by a 3rd party vendor. While it allows a lot more personalization and ease of access to the cloud you are giving up the security of what you are putting on the cloud. Public is the cheaper option saving companies the expenses of having to host and maintain on-site servers. In a public cloud the cloud provider is responsible for cloud management and maintenance of the server.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <h3>Hybrid</h3>
          <p>A hybrid could is the mixture of private and public cloud. The hybrid cloud allows certain products to be shared on a private cloud while other non confidential data can be kept on the public cloud. This a more cost efficient solution to wanting a private cloud. The hybrid cloud is the best of both world taking advantage or a low cost point while still having a low possibily of data breach for confidintial data.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
          <p>More and more companies are moving away from private cloud and switching to a public or hybrid cloud as it is more cost effective and the security of these providers are becoming more reliable. Software development companies would prefer private cloud as it is more secure giving them security while developing new technologies and allows the companies to develope and test these products before releasing them to the public.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
          <p>Companies that would prefer the public cloud are usually start ups and small business, but is now increasing to big businesses with the increased security they offer. The reason small companies and start ups want the public is becasue of the cost effectiveness of the storage. These companies want fast and reliable servers such as google drive and use this for theyre company storage.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
          <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
          <p>More and more companies such as Marriott are starting to use the Hybrid cloud. The reason that they prefer this is because it is the best of both worlds while you are able to develope and test products, and store confidential data on the private cloud, while still being able to transfer normal data over the public cloud.</p>
