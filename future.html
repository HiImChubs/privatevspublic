          <h3>Economic Future</h3>
          <p>Cloud Computing is a becoming more common use in the business world. This is allowing for companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to start their own public cloud providing softwares. As more and more companies jump on board with cloud computing more money is put into the field allowing for rapid growth in scalabitiy and security. According to Louis Columbus from Forbes the Cloud Computing Market is estemated to reach 411 Billion dollars by 2020. </p>

          <h3>Security Future</h3>
            <p>While more and more companies trust 3rd party public cloud companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to handle their data, security for these companies has to increase to handle confidintial data. Certain data like credit card numbers or health information would be held in on-site servers similar to private cloud servers to prevent breach. Amazon offers 3rd party audit reports to show that the process is safe and effective in holding confidetial data in their servers. Companies such as Netflix, and Nasa have trusted Amazon with their data in the cloud showing that the security of private cloud is coming closer in comparison the the public cloud.</p>
