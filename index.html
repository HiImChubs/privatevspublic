        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"><h3>What is Cloud Storage?</h3>
          <p>Cloud storage is data held in a server, usually held by a company such as google or amazon, which is backed up remotely and made readily avaliable to users over a network. Cloud is a better instalation than bare metal installation due to the ability to transfer information quickly through the company and the ability to scale with the companies needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6"><h3>Private</h3>
          <p>Private cloud storage is privately hosted servers that are private to the user and company. These servers are mostly used in big business where said company has confidential data that is private to that company. While these servers are more protected than public they are still subject to breaches shown when Target lost millions of customer data to a malicious attack.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6"><h3>Public</h3>
          <p>Public data is most commonly know through providers like google with the google drive. These servers are most commonly used as of base storage for companies. This storage type while unprotected is effective in storing information due to the ability to "infinitley scale" to company needs, and distribute information company wide.</p>
