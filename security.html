          <h3>Issues with Private</h3>
          <p>While private clouds are the most protected servers and almost imposible to breach, there are easier ways to get into private cloud servers. While exclusivly employees can access the private cloud it is easy for a person to hijack an account of the person to access the cloud. They can also find people on the inside of a company to give them access using phishing emails and other tactics.</p>

          <h3>Issues With Public</h3>
            <p>Big Businesses are looking for new cheaper ways to host data and are looking to cloud for this feature, but there are big risks in public clouds. A company in the UK called TalkTalk Telecom Group were fined $500,000 for a security breach which led to a leak of personal data of 157,000 customers. This could have easily been fixed. More Detail Below.</p>

          <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
          <p>In private clouds one of the ways to solve problems such as phishing emails and malicious links, need to be educated on what malicious links, and phishing emails look like. These things are easy ways to protect your workers data and the companies data. Malicious links are very dangerous for securty, by simply clicking a link someone sent you, that person can download a back door with out you knowing and remotely control your computer accessing data within the companies cloud.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
          <p>Some of the easiest way to protect data on a public cloud is data encryption. Data encryption is essential for confidintial data. Data encryption works by passing through 'filters' on its way to the destination in this case the cloud. Once it reaches its final destination it passes through a final filter that removes the encryption making it almost imposible to hack while the data is in being moved to the new location. The significance of this was shown when the breach talked about previously with TalkTalk took place leaking the infromation of over 150,000 users. This could have easily been prevented using data encryption.</p>
